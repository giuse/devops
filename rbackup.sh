# TODO NEXT:
# - add server user name to configuration
# - add username to ssh calls: dests need to be either path or srv port user path
# - cli parser
# - verify writing permissions on destination directory d rwx r-x --- # ${rcmd} mkdir -p -m 750 "${path}"
# - load_conf implementation
# - notification popup of starting + result of backup
# - cron integration
# - function to restore a folder (works also for full backup)
# - write backup conf depending on GUI choices
# - create file for rsync exclusions, use it, back it up, then delete it
